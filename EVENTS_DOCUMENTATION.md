# Social Savings Missions - Contract Events Documentation

This document outlines all events emitted by the Social Savings Missions smart contracts for analytics and data analysis purposes.

## Overview

All contracts emit rich, indexed events that capture key user actions, state changes, and business metrics. These events are designed to be easily queried and analyzed for dashboard creation and KPI tracking.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Using these events, you can calculate the following KPIs:

### Growth & Adoption
- **Total Value Locked (TVL)**: Sum of all deposits across active missions
- **Number of Active Missions**: Count of MissionCreated events minus completed missions
- **New Users**: Count of AddressBound events over time
- **Number of Squads Formed**: Derived from squad-related events

### User Engagement & Retention
- **Mission Completion Rate**: MissionCompleted / (MissionCreated Ã— average participants)
- **Average Deposit Amount**: Average of Deposit.amount values
- **D1/D7/D30 Retention**: User activity patterns over time
- **Average Streak Length**: Average of finalStreak from MissionCompleted events
- **Distribution of Squad Sizes**: From SquadBonusDistributed.squadSize

### Social & Virality
- **Referral Tree Depth & Breadth**: Track user invitation chains
- **Chat-Triggered Actions**: LINE webhook events (external to contracts)

## CSV Export Format

The analytics export script generates a CSV with the following columns:

```csv
Event Type,Contract Address,Mission Pool,User,Line ID Hash,User Address,Creator,Target Amount,Cadence (seconds),Duration (seconds),Asset Address,Yield Strategy,Reward Distributor,Amount,New Streak,Total Deposited,Previous Streak,Final Streak,Remaining Balance,Base Reward,Bonus Reward,Total Reward,Total Participants,Total Deposited,Total Yield,Timestamp,Block Number,Transaction Hash
```

## Dune Analytics Integration

### Direct Integration (if supported)
If Dune supports Kaia network directly:
1. Connect your wallet to Dune
2. Create queries using the contract addresses
3. Use the event signatures above to decode logs

### CSV Upload Fallback
1. Run `npm run export:csv` in the backend directory
2. Upload the generated `social_savings_analytics.csv` to Dune
3. Create datasets and dashboards from the uploaded data

## Query Examples

### Daily Active Users
```sql
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user) as dau
FROM deposits
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY date DESC
```

### Mission Success Rate
```sql
SELECT
  mission_pool,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user) as participants,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'MissionCompleted' THEN 1 END) as completions,
  ROUND(completions * 100.0 / participants, 2) as success_rate
FROM mission_events
GROUP BY mission_pool
```

### TVL Over Time
```sql
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) as date,
  SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) as tvl
FROM deposits
ORDER BY date
```

This comprehensive event system provides all the data needed to build detailed analytics dashboards and track the success of the Social Savings Missions protocol.
